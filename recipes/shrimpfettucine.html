        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Who doesn't love a good pasta dish?! When I'm craving some italian and seafood, my first thought is always shrimp alfredo. You can use any pasta and pair it with a veggie of your choice (or don't), either way, still delicious!</p>
        <p>This meal makes for a great comfort food night paired with some garlic bread. Or, a modest lunch in the summer preceded by a light salad. Maybe even a nice wine for a romantic date night meal. Whatever the occasion, this meal is sure to be a winner.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 box dry fettucine pasta (16 oz)</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cup butter(divided)</li>
            <li>1 pint heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>3/4 cup grated Roman cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>3 cloves of garlic, crushed (divided)</li>
            <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
            <li>8 oz diced mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 (8 oz) package frozen shrimp, deveined (with or without tail), thawed</li>

            <li>dash of paprika</li>
            <li>2 tbsp chopped parsley</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot, bring lightly salted water to a boil over medium heat. When ready, stir in fettucine pasta, return to a boil and cook until tender yet firm to the bite, or about 8-10 minutes. Drain and keep warm.</li><br>
            <li>Heat 1 cup of butter and cream in a large saucepan over meadium heat. When butter melts, add both cheeses (Romano and Parmesan), 1/3 of the crushed garlic, salt, paprika, and pepper. Cook and stir until cheese melts and sauce thickens, about 5-6 minutes. Remove from heat.</li><br>
            <li>Heat the remaining 1/4 cup butter and olive oil in another saucepan over medium heat. When butter melts, add onion and saut&eacute; for about 2-3 minutes. Stir in mushrooms and remaining crushed garlic. Increase heat to medium-high and cook until mushrooms are soft for about 2 minutes. Add shrimp and cook for about 2 minutes on each side or until bright pink on the outside and opaque on the inside.</li><br>
            <li>Fold the shrimp mixture into the alfredo sauce. Add drained fettucine and toss to coat. Top with parsley.</li>
