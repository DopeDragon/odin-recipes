            <li>Lightly spray an 9-inch square baking pan with cooking spray. Line with parchment

            <li>For the brownies, in a large bowl, combine chocolate chips and butter. Melt in 30-second increments, on high heat in the microwave. Stir in between increments.</li><br>

            <li>Add dry mix to wet mix and stir vigorously until the mixture is smooth and begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl. This will take 1-2 minutes.</li><br>
            <li>Stir in mini chocolate chips.</li><br>
            <li>Pour 2/3 of the brownie batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Set aside mixture.</li><br>

            <li>Beat in the egg and vanilla extract until smooth.</li><br>

            <li>Drizzle or spoon the remaining brownie batter over the top.</li><br>
            <li>Bake for 30-35 minutes or until inserted toothpick comes out with a few moist crumbs.</li><br>
            <li>Let cool completely in pan. Use the parchment paper overhang to pull the brownies out and cut into squares.</li><br>
