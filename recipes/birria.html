        <h3>Tacos</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>18 corn tortillas</li>
            <li>1 large white onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 bunch of cilantro, chopped</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded queso asadero (white Mexican cheese)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees (&ordm;F). Fill a pot with water and bring to a boil.</li><br>
            <li>Add the chile peppers to the boiling water and boil for about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and allow peppers to soak until cool. 
                Drain and reserve 1/4 cup of the cooking water.</li><br>
            <li>Rinse the beef and pat dry with paper towels. Cut beef into chunks and season with salt and pepper.</li><br>
            <li>Heat oil in a Dutch over over medium-high heat. Add beef and cook until browned on all sides for about 10 minutes. Remove from heat.</li><br>
            <li>While the beef is searing, continue the sauce. Line a cast iron grill pan or griddle with aluminum foil and place over high heat.
                Arrange tomatoes in a single layer on top. Grill until tomato skin is burned on all sides and begins to peel n(3-5 minutes).</li><br>
            <li>Place cooled chile peppers into a blender. Add vinegar, garlic, 2 tsp black pepper, cloves, cinnamon, cumin, thyme, marjoram, oregano, and salt to the blender.
                Pour in reserved 1/4 cup of chile water and blend until smooth.</li><br>
            <li>Strain chile sauce through a mesh strainer and pour over browned meat in the Dutch oven, turning the roast so it is completely covered with sauce. Cover with lid.</li><br>
            <li>Bake the roast in the preheated oven, basting meat every 45 minutes with sauce. Birria should start to fall apart after about 3-4 hours. Bake uncovered until birria is crispy on top 
                for about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven, cover with 2 layers of aluminum foil, and allow to rest for 10 minutes.</li><br>
            <li>Remove meat from oven and move to a cutting board. Strain off any fat from the sauce. Shred meat with 2 forks, then return to the pot and stir with the sauce to combine.</li><br>
            <li>Fill each tortilla with birria and top with Mexican cheese, chopped onions, and cilantro. Warm tortillas on a griddle, flipping until both sides are crispy and cheese is melted.</li><br>
            <li>Serve with extra sauce on the side for dipping.</li><br>
        </ol>
