Project Recipes!
Under this project, we will build a basic recipe website. We will be using the skills that we learned so far to show our work in the text editor and push to github to showcase a functional site. The purpose of this project is to build up HTML skills that we have learned so far. I am super excited to put my knowledge of HTML to the test!
